# README

This is a simple web application, built as a work test.

## Solution

I use DAWA's autocomplete API to fetch address data and store the user data in localStorage. Data integrity is maintained by simply not letting the user manually edit the address data.

### 3rd-party libraries

- I decided to use **Bootstrap**, mainly because I have been curious about bootstrap for a long time, and because styling components manually takes forever.
- **react-bootstrap-typeahead** was perfect, doing exactly what I wanted it to. ðŸ˜Š
- **@emotion/styled** because I am familiar with it and I like it.
- **Axios** rather than fetch. Better browser support, as well as (imho) easier to use.

### Caveats

#### 1. It looks like crap

I am not a designer, and that is not what I am applying as. If you give me a design and tell me to make it happen, sure, but building things from scratch? Nah. (I can do it ironically... ðŸ¤ª ) I can download free templates, that's about it.

Hm. How would that work with react/bootstrap? ðŸ¤” Yay, something to learn! ðŸ¥³

#### 2. MVP

Apart from the design being crap I would call this an mvp, *based on the requirements* (...at least at the time of writing). Any less would be unusable, any more would be bonus material.

I think it will give you an idea of my skills or lack thereof, as well as some insight into how I work.

It was quite a fun task, so I may well continue building it. There is always extra room in my portfolio!
